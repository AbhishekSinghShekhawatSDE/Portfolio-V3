This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio and professional platform, available at **[www.abhisheksinghshekhawat.com](https://www.abhisheksinghshekhawat.com/)**.

This project was engineered from the ground up not just as a static page, but as a comprehensive platform to showcase my skills in full-stack development, DevOps, and cloud engineering. It was built with a "product mindset," focusing on elite performance, robust security, and a premium user experience.
